            <p id="par1">A quick experience overview of myself. My name is Vanity Brown, I am 26 years young.
            I started in the food industry at the age of 18, and quickly realized that it was not for me.
            Nothing could have prepared me for the best thing I have done for myself thus far, and that was joining the YearUp program.
            Over the years I have developed my skills of communication, quick thinking, leadership,
            and being a team player. I hope this page is a reflection of my newly taught skills.

            <h3 id="header3">Other Accomplishments</h3>
            <p id="par6">I was enrolled in the Woodland Job corps center in Laurel, MD for nine months back in March of 2018 and successfully graduated the program in December 2018.
                I was successful in the Carpentry trade and held a job for 2 years working with carpenters twice my age. I learned that outside was not the place for me but I am grateful to
                have learned such a useful skill. I felt lost in life and heard about the YearUp opportunity 2 years later, I took full advantage and dived right into their most rigourous course, Application Development.
                I have only touched the surface of Java, Unit Testing, and Backend API's, now learning and utilizing HTML, JavaScript and CSS. Google and W3 Schools has become a good friend I plan to use for as long as I can.
                I am proud of my progress thus far and understand that I have much to learn, no matter how intimidating my instructor comes off, I know it's for good reason and it won't deter me from achieving my goals.
